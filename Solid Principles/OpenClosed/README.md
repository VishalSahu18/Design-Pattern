# Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**Definition:**

A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Explanation:**

We should be able to extend a class's behavior without modifying its existing code. This prevents breaking existing functionality.

**Example (Violating OCP):**  

```java
class PaymentProcessor {
    public void processPayment(String paymentType) {
    
        if (paymentType.equals("CreditCard")) {
            // Process credit card payment
        } else if (paymentType.equals("PayPal")) {
            // Process PayPal payment
        }
    }
}

```

**What's wrong?**

Every time a new payment method is added (e.g., Google Pay), we need to modify the class.
Following OCP with Polymorphism


**Correct Approach**
Following OCP with Polymorphism

```java
 interface PaymentMethod {
    void pay();
}

class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentMethod {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Processing Credit Card payment...");
    }
}

class PayPalPayment implements PaymentMethod {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment...");
    }
}

class PaymentProcessor {
    public void processPayment(PaymentMethod paymentMethod) {
        paymentMethod.pay();
    }
}

```

**Why is this better?**

We can add new payment methods without modifying existing code.  
The system is more extensible.  

**What happens if we donâ€™t follow OCP?**

ðŸ”´ Frequent Modifications â†’ Every time we add a feature, we modify existing code.  
ðŸ”´ Higher Risk of Bugs â†’ Changes may break the existing functionality.  
ðŸ”´ Hard to Scale â†’ Extending functionality is painful.  

**Benefits of OCP**

âœ… Easier feature addition â†’ New features can be added without modifying old code.  
âœ… Less risk of bugs â†’ Existing functionality remains untouched.  
âœ… More flexible code â†’ Code can evolve over time.
