# SOLID Principles in Object-Oriented Design

SOLID is an acronym that represents five principles of object-oriented design that help make software more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand. 

ðŸ”¹ **Without SOLID** â†’ Tightly coupled, hard-to-maintain, error-prone code.  

ðŸ”¹ **With SOLID** â†’ Scalable, flexible, and maintainable software.


| Principle | Definition     | Key Benefit |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| SRP       | One class, one responsibility.   | Better maintainability.  |
| OCP       | Open for extension, closed for modification.     | Easier to add features.  |
| LSP       | Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types. | Avoids unexpected behavior.  |
| ISP       | Avoid forcing classes to implement unused methods.     | Improves flexibility.  |
| DIP       | 	Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations. | Reduces coupling.  |
