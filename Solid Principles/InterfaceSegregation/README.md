# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Definition:**

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.

**Explanation:**

A single large interface should be broken down into smaller, more specific interfaces.

**Example (Violating ISP):**

```java
interface Worker {
    void work();
    void eat();
}

class Developer implements Worker {
    public void work() {
        System.out.println("Writing code...");
    }

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating lunch...");
    }
}

class Robot implements Worker {
    public void work() {
        System.out.println("Performing automated tasks...");
    }

    public void eat() {
        // Robots don't eat!
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Robots don't eat!");
    }
}

```
**What's wrong?**

The Robot class is forced to implement eat(), which it does not need.

**Correct Approach (Following ISP):**


```java
interface Workable {
    void work();
}

interface Eatable {
    void eat();
}

class Developer implements Workable, Eatable {
    public void work() {
        System.out.println("Writing code...");
    }

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating lunch...");
    }
}

class Robot implements Workable {
    public void work() {
        System.out.println("Performing automated tasks...");
    }
}

```

**Why is this better?**  

Classes only implement the methods they actually need.


**What happens if we donâ€™t follow ISP?**  

ðŸ”´ Unnecessary Implementations â†’ Classes are forced to implement methods they donâ€™t use.  
ðŸ”´ Code Breaks Easily â†’ Any change in the interface affects all classes.  
ðŸ”´ Difficult Maintenance â†’ More changes required when modifying an interface.  

**Benefits of ISP**  
âœ… Less impact of changes â†’ Only relevant classes are affected.  
âœ… Easier to understand â†’ Each interface is smaller and more focused.  
âœ… More flexible code â†’ Different parts of the system evolve independently.
