**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

**Definition:**

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.

**Explanation:**

Each class should focus on a single functionality. If a class has multiple responsibilities, changes in one part may affect others, leading to maintenance difficulties.

**Example (Violating SRS):**

```java

class Marker {

    String name;
    String color;
    int year;
    int price;

    public Marker(String name,String color,int  year,int price){
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
        this.year = year;
        this.price = price;
    }
}


class Invoice {

    private Marker marker;
    private int quantity;

    public Invoice(Marker marker,int quantity){
        this.marker  = marker;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    public int calculateTotal(){
        int price = ((marker.price)*this.quantity);
        return price;
    }

    public void printInvoice(){
        //print the Invoice
    }

    public void saveToDB(){
        //save the data into DB
    }

}

```
**What's wrong?**

The Invoice class has three responsibilities:

Calculating total.  
Printing the invoice.  
Saving the invoice to the database.  

This makes the class difficult to maintain.

**Correct Approach**  
Make a separate class for each responsibility such it has only have single reason to change.

```java

class Invoice {
    
    private Marker marker;
    private int quantity;

    public Invoice(Marker marker , int quantity){
        this.marker = marker;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }
    
    public int calculateTotal(){
        int price = ((marker.price)*this.quantity);
        return price;
    }
}


class InvoiceDao {
    
    Invoice invoice;
    public InvoiceDao(Invoice invoice){
        this.invoice = invoice;
    }
    
    public void saveToDB(){
        // Save into the DB
    }

}

class InvoicePrinter {
    
    private Invoice invoice;

    public InvoicePrinter(Invoice invoice){
        this.invoice = invoice;
    }
    
    public void print(){
        // print the invoice
    }
}
```

**Why is this better?**

Each class has a single responsibility.  
The design is more maintainable.  


**What happens if we donâ€™t follow SRP?**  
ðŸ”´ High Complexity â†’ The class has too many responsibilities, making it hard to understand.  
ðŸ”´ Difficult Maintenance â†’ A change in one responsibility may break another.  
ðŸ”´ Poor Code Reusability â†’ You can't reuse a part of the logic easily.  

**Benefits of SRP**  
âœ… Easier to maintain â†’ Each class has only one reason to change.  
âœ… Better reusability â†’ Each class does one thing well.  
âœ… Improved readability â†’ Code is easier to understand.
