# Design-Pattern

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They provide a standard approach to solving issues in software architecture and development.

**Types of Design Patterns**

Design patterns are classified into three main categories:

*Creational Patterns* – Focus on object creation mechanisms.  
*Structural Patterns* – Deal with object composition and structure.  
*Behavioral Patterns* – Define communication between objects and how responsibilities are distributed.
